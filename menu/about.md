Hi, I'm zaccone (obviously not my real name). I'm a mid-30s Australian guy that has, in the spirit of Ryan Holiday's [Alive Time vs Dead Time](https://humanparts.medium.com/will-you-choose-alive-time-or-dead-time-8d7b8ba212) article, decided to start something whilst wasting away in corporate-land.

### What will I be writing about?

Well first, maybe it helps to give a bit of background, For years, I have dreamed of getting free of the rat race, and have read hundreds (*probably thousands actually*) of books & articles about how to reach that goal. Everything from entrepeneurship, to career development, to FIRE, to get-rich-quick, to investing - I've voraciously consumed the content and then in true wantrepeneur *(look it up)* fashion largely failed to implement most of it.

What makes me different from most of these writers, however, is my starting point. On Jan 1st, 2019, I had rought **$68k in personal debt**, no assets to speak of, and an ok job that was interesting but paying me fuck all. Not an ideal situation when you spend most of your day dreaming about packing it all in and getting out. 

So the penny finally dropped, and I decided to stop fucking about and start implementing. Generally it has been working, and I'm slowly on the path to getting where I want to be.

### So now again - what will I be writing about?

Some basic principles:

* I'll be doing my best to summarise everything I've absorbed over the last few years, and give my thoughts about what to use and what to discard. There is a ton of good material out there, but in nearly every case its surrounded with layers of irrelevant crap. Think of it like an ideas repository with links to whats useful and interesting.

* I'll track what I've implemented, what worked for me, and what hasn't. There will be swearing.

* I'll give detail about my path to "Financial Indepence", and what that even means to me *(Hint: it wont look like any other FI blog you've read before)*. I will show numbers. 

* I will be aggressive. This won't be a blog about cutting lattes and selling shit on gumtree to add extra pennies. It will focus on big wins and compounding gains, and will likely fly in the face of conventional financial wisdom. 

In short, I will try and present an alternative path to getting free for all of the people like me that are starting in a hole. If you like what you read, [hit me up on twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%40zacconeau), or [email](mailto:zacconeau@protonmail.com) and tell me so I don't pack this in :)

If you don't, thats cool. Go and buy Scott Pape's book and enjoy your path to the middle. Just please don't hang around telling me how wrong I am, because I don't care.

Cheers, and hope you enjoy!
